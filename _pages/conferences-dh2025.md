The latest DHA conference of the Australasian Association for Digital Humanities (aaDH) will be held in December 2025. It will be held in Canberra on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people at the Australian National University, hosted by the HASS Digital Research Hub and the College of Arts and Social Sciences.

DHA2025 [‘Digital Archipelagos’](https://dha25.org/) will focus on how scholars can conceptualise the fragmentation, clustering, dispersion, and interconnection of data in the Digital Humanities in discussions that prioritise local experiences and networks to challenge dominant narratives. In an age of algorithmic ubiquity, this conference aims to examine how seemingly isolated ‘islands’ of knowledge can remain distinct but intricately connected across evolving global contexts.
